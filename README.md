## Overview

- **Personal Project:** I enjoyed creating the CarParkingSupportSystem, however, I never got around to finishing that project due to studies. I have started this, and plan to finish it to the best of my ability.
- **Programming:** I wanted a challenge, and I am aware this project requires a lot of research.
- **Additional Programming:** I will try to integrate new features in this system in the near future. These features will not be common on airlines, but I do believe it could hold some value. 
- **Programming language:** I chose to do this in Python due to working with **Python3** for many years now. I also chose Python because this system is mainly data oriented. I will also try to implement other languages to optimise if necessary.
- **Inspiration:** I will be using the Emirate Airline as an inspiration. I will of course use other airline details, however, I have flown with them many of times and understand a little about their system, from ticketing to backend data processing.

## Context

For now, information of my project research can be found here:
[Research & Development Plan](https://github.com/alexsmith2910/AirlinePassengerServiceSystem/blob/master/airline%20pss.txt)

This is because I am still in the research process. 

## Installation and usage

> :warning: **This has not been setup yet!**

You can download the all the files and run a couple of commands for it to work.

1. Download the files.
2. Open a new terminal > Navigate to the download folder > Type <br>
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`<br>
    or <br>
    `python -m  pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Install a [Mongo Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) >
   follow the steps and install [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)
   to view the database easily.
4. Then you can run the program `main.py` in terminal or open the file manually.
